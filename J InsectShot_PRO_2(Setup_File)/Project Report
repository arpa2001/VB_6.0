The wizard has built 3 cab(s) for your application. The cabs are in 'C:\PRO_FILES\InsectShot_PRO_2\Insect_Shot Setup'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (C:\PRO_FILES\InsectShot_PRO_2\Insect_Shot Setup\Support\Insect Shot.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab files in case you make changes to some of the files.
